# WeatherApp

## Tools, Technologies - 
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [CoreLocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation)

> **Core Location** provides services that determine a deviceâ€™s geographic location, altitude, and orientation, or its position relative to a nearby iBeacon device. The framework gathers data using all available components on the device, including the Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, magnetometer, barometer, and cellular hardware.

## Modifications - 
- This app has been made based on [this youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/X2W9MPjrIbk).
- Apart from the tutorial, I've made some UI changes to make it look better and in addition to that, I've fetched weather icons directly froom the API itself.
